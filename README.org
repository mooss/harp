#+title: Harp, Homoiconic array-represented programming (language)
#+author: FÃ©lix Jamet

* What ?

A Lisp-inspired programming language using arrays as the primary data structure instead of lists.

Its other characteristic is to be implemented in a literate programming style, using Emacs's Org Mode.

* Why ?

To waste everybody's time with yet another Lisp.
More seriously, to have some fun, to learn about Lisp and to answer the question "what are the implications of an array-based Lisp ?".

The motivation comes partly from https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/, a post about SectorLISP stating that:
#+begin_quote
Fast immediate garbage collection with zero memory overhead and perfect heap defragmentation is as easy as ABC when your language guarantees data structures are acyclic.
#+end_quote

This looks like a very interesting property.
My intuition is that replacing lists with arrays and using a different set of primitives could be another way to ensure acyclic data structures.
I don't know whether those principles make any sense but it will at least be subjectively interesting.
